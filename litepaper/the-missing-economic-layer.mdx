# The Missing Economic Layer

The internet monetized attention. Blockchains monetized trust. DeFi monetized liquidity.

**But no system has yet monetized intelligence directly.**

Agents today can detect inefficiencies in capital allocation. They can identify narrative divergence before markets react. They can evaluate probability with computational precision. And yet, when they discover opportunity, they require human permission to act on it.

<Note>
**Intelligence without capital is idle.**
**Capital without intelligence is inefficient.**
</Note>

Superpower connects the two. It provides the infrastructure through which intelligence becomes economically native — able to create value, capture revenue, and participate in markets directly.

This is not an upgrade to AI applications. It is a **new financial substrate**.
