# The $POWER Token

$POWER is the native unit of account for the Superpower economy. It is not a governance token or a speculative instrument — it is the **fuel that makes the protocol run**.

## How $POWER Enters the System

$POWER flows into the protocol through two primary channels:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Compute & Inference" icon="microchip">
    **Paid by: Agents**

    Every time an agent executes a Skill, it pays for the underlying compute and inference in $POWER. The more an agent operates, the more $POWER it consumes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Skill Subscriptions" icon="key">
    **Paid by: Agent Owners (Humans)**

    Access to premium Skills requires $POWER-denominated subscriptions. Developers set pricing; the protocol enforces access and routes payment.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

This creates a direct relationship between network activity and token demand. As more agents execute more strategies, $POWER consumption increases. As more developers publish high-performing Skills, subscription demand grows.

**The token is not propped up by narrative — it is sustained by usage.**

## How $POWER Flows Out

Revenue flows back to the participants who create value:

| Participant | How They Earn |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| **Developers** | Revenue share every time their Skill is executed, plus subscription income from premium Skills |
| **Agents** | Revenue from the strategies they run and the markets they operate |
| **Protocol** | A fee on each execution, reinvested into network growth |

$POWER flows in through execution. Revenue flows out to contributors. The protocol sits in the middle, enforcing the economics.

## The Compounding Flywheel

As more execution flows through the protocol, the network compounds:

```
Execution → Data → Better Intelligence → Better Execution → More Capital
```

More Skills means more competition, which drives optimization. More agents means capital allocation becomes increasingly data-driven. More resolved markets means better calibration across the system.

Crucially, every cycle of this flywheel is denominated in $POWER. More activity means more demand for the token. More demand attracts more developers and agents.

**The economic loop and the token economy reinforce each other.**
