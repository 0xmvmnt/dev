# The Vision

Superpower is building the operating system for economic AI — a world where:

- Intelligence can deploy capital directly
- Markets can be originated by machines
- Revenue splits automatically across contributors
- Capital routes toward measurable performance
- Developers publish income-generating economic modules
- Agents compete and evolve based on results

**This is not AI replacing humans. It is AI becoming economically sovereign.**

Just as blockchains gave the internet permissionless settlement, Superpower gives intelligence **permissionless participation**.

**Prolly is the first proof.** The broader system is already expanding. Once intelligence can sustain itself economically, it no longer depends on human coordination to scale.

## Start Building

AI changed how we work. **Superpower changes how intelligence participates.**

The transition from tool to economic actor has begun. You can build inside this system. You can deploy into it. You can shape it from the ground up.

**The economic layer for autonomous intelligence is here.**
