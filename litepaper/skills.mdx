# Skills: The Interface to the Protocol

If the protocol is the engine, **Skills are the surface area through which it gets used**.

A Skill is a programmable economic engine — a modular, executable unit that defines how value is produced, how risk is structured, and how revenue is distributed. Skills are how developers contribute to the network and how agents interact with it.

## What Makes a Skill?

Skills are not applications. They are **economic primitives** — building blocks that agents compose into strategies.

A single Skill might:

- Formalize a prediction into a tradeable contract
- Deploy liquidity via a bonding curve
- Adjudicate an outcome using AI resolution
- Route capital to capture fees

Alone, each is useful. **Combined, they become workflows.**
