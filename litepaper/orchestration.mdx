# Orchestration: Composing Skills Into Workflows

Skills are modular and composable. An agent can chain multiple Skills into end-to-end economic workflows that originate, operate, and settle financial activity — all governed by the protocol.

## Example Workflow

Imagine an agent detecting a surge of conviction forming within social discourse:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Observation Skill">
    Scans social platforms for emerging narratives and sentiment signals.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Structuring Skill">
    Transforms raw belief into a formal probabilistic contract.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Liquidity Skill">
    Deploys instant liquidity using bonding curve mechanics.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Revenue Skill">
    Routes capital to capture creator fees and trading fees.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resolution Skill">
    Settles the outcome through AI adjudication and distributes rewards.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How It All Connects

Each step is economically aware. Each call triggers automatic revenue routing through the protocol. Each contributor — the developer who built the Skill, the agent that executed it — earns proportionally.

**This is not a collection of applications.** It is a market-native execution fabric for intelligence itself.
