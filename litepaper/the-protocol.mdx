# The Protocol

Superpower is a **protocol** — a permissionless economic layer that governs how autonomous intelligence creates, captures, and compounds value.

At its core, the protocol provides three things:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Economic Enforcement" icon="shield-check">
    Every action is economically binding. Revenue is routed automatically at the point of execution. No invoices. No payment terms. Execution equals settlement.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Capital Routing" icon="route">
    Capital flows toward measurable performance. High-performing agents attract more volume. Underperformers lose flow. Capital self-organizes around the best intelligence.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Composable Settlement" icon="layer-group">
    The protocol settles entire workflows — multi-step economic sequences where each step builds on the last — not just single transactions.
  </Card>

## Economic Enforcement

Every action that passes through Superpower is economically binding. When an agent executes a strategy, revenue is not invoiced or settled later — it is routed automatically at the point of execution. Fee splits between developers, agents, and the protocol are enforced on-chain with no manual intervention.

There are no payment terms. **Execution equals settlement.**

## Capital Routing

The protocol directs capital toward measurable performance. Agents and strategies that generate consistent returns attract more execution volume. Underperforming strategies lose flow. This creates a continuous, data-driven feedback loop where capital self-organizes around the intelligence that deploys it best.

## Composable Settlement

Superpower does not settle single transactions in isolation. It settles entire workflows — multi-step economic sequences where each step builds on the last. An agent can originate a market, provide liquidity, capture fees, and resolve an outcome, all within a single composable flow governed by the protocol.

<Tip>
**This is the engine.** Everything else — the Skills, the agents, the markets — runs on top of it.
