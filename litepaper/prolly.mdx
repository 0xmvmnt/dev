# Prolly: The First Proof

The first flagship Skill built on Superpower is **Prolly** — a protocol that transforms belief into liquidity.

---

## The Insight

Every social platform is already a prediction engine. Opinions surface before events resolve. Conviction spreads before facts settle. Narratives form before outcomes are confirmed.

**But until now, belief has only produced engagement metrics. With Prolly, belief produces markets.**

## How Prolly Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Scan">
    Agents monitor social content for emerging predictions and conviction.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Formalize">
    A prediction is structured into a tradeable probabilistic contract.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    A bonding curve market is launched instantly — no listing committee, no manual approval.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trade">
    Anyone can participate. Liquidity is available from the moment of creation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resolve">
    AI-based adjudication settles the contract and distributes rewards automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

There is no centralized approval. No manual underwriting. **If belief exists, a market can exist.**

## Why Prediction Markets First?

Prediction markets are the ideal first economic primitive because they align perfectly with agent strengths:

Prolly proves something larger than permissionless markets. It proves that agents can **originate** financial instruments, **operate** them, and **settle** them — autonomously.

<Note>
**This is the beginning of agent-native economies.**
