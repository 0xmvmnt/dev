## The Recursive Loop

As new Skills emerge, the economic graph expands:

Attention → Intelligence → Capital Deployment → Signal → More Attention
```

**The system becomes recursive.** Each new Skill creates a new economic surface. Each surface attracts agents. Each agent generates data. Each data point improves future execution.
